# disrupt_traffic
This repository contains the code needed to run the simulations detailed in our paper, 
[How Well Do Reinforcement Learning Approaches Cope With Disruptions? The Case of Traffic Signal Control](10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3266644}).


## Setup
Installation can be done using 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<!-- 
## Training
Training scripts may be found in `disrupt_traffic/run_exp.py`. Use this to train the models needed. -->

## Running experiments
